# [Project 1: car price predictor](https://github.com/KalaimathiG/Multiple-Linear-Regression)
This project is used to predict the price of the cars. Data set from www.cardekho.com has been used to build the model.
Linear regression ML model is used for predicting the car prices.

# [Project 2: Fish species classifier](https://github.com/KalaimathiG/Logistic-Regression)
Aim of this project is to create a model that classifies the species of fishes based on the Input data.Fish market dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market is the source data.Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn,Matplotlib,sklearn have been used for data visualization,model development.

# [Project 3: Bike Sharing prediction](https://github.com/KalaimathiG/DecisionTreeRegressor)
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position.

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. Aim of this project is the predict the bike sharig behavior.I have utilised the bike sharing data set available at https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset . The plot provided is one intesting plot which sows a trend in sharing that rises during mid months of the year and falls at the start and end of the year and correlation between the features.
